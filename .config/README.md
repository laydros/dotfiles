# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles managed with `yadm`.
It is intentionally minimal to avoid over-engineering. Configuration
files live directly in the repo so they can be symlinked into `$HOME`
by `yadm`.

## Structure

- `bin/` – personal helper scripts
- `.config/` – application configuration (nvim, sway, tmux, etc.)
- `.vim/` – Vim configuration shared with Neovim

Feel free to adapt pieces for your own setup.
