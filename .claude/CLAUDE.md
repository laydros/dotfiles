## Documentation Update Policy

  When implementing new features, fixing bugs, or making significant changes to any codebase, ALWAYS proactively update the
  relevant documentation files:

### Files to Update

  1. **README.md** - Update when:
     - Adding new features or tools
     - Changing CLI commands or usage patterns
     - Modifying installation or setup procedures
     - Adding new dependencies or requirements
     - Updating project structure or file organization

  2. **CLAUDE.md** - Update when:
     - Adding new commands or usage examples
     - Changing architecture or core components
     - Adding new testing procedures or files
     - Modifying development workflows
     - Adding new dependencies or configuration options

  3. **AGENTS.md** - Update when:
     - Adding new features that other AI agents should know about
     - Changing build/run procedures
     - Adding new development guidelines or conventions
     - Modifying project structure or key components

### Documentation Workflow

- Always use the TodoWrite tool to track documentation updates as separate tasks
- Complete documentation updates in the same session as the feature implementation, not as a follow-up task
- Be specific about new functionality and usage
- Include relevant code examples and commands
- Update any affected sections (roadmap, features, structure, etc.)
- Keep documentation accurate and current with the implementation

  **Priority**: Documentation updates should be treated as high-priority tasks that are completed alongside code changes, not
  optional afterthoughts.
